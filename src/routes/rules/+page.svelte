    <h1>Global Discord Rules</h1>
    <p>
        1. Display common sense: do not excessively harass other members of the community, or participate in immoral activity.
    </p>
    <p>
        1a. Respect others regardless of race, sexual orientation, gender, or other factors. 
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Advertising is accepted, as long as it isn't the sole purpose of you joining this community.
    </p>
        3. No excessive NSFW or suggestive remarks, especially if done to the point that server members get uncomfortable with the situation.
    <p>
        4. Use channels for their dedicated purpose: this includes isolating spam and bot commands to only the #spam channel.
