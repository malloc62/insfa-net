    <h1>Global Discord Rules</h1>
    <p>
        1. Display common sense: do not excessively harass other members of the community, be a nusiance, or participate in immoral activity.
    </p>
    <p>
        1a. Respect others regardless of race, sexual orientation, gender, or other factors.

    <p>
        2. Advertising is accepted, as long as it isn't the sole purpose of you joining this community.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. No excessive NSFW, suggestive remarks, or sensitive jokes, especially if done to the point that server members get uncomfortable with the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. Use channels for their dedicated purpose: this includes isolating spam and bot commands to only the #spam channel.
    </p>

    <h1>PlanarCraph Rules</h1>
    <p>
        1. You may not grief land that is owned by a nation that isn't yours, nor can you severely grief unclaimed land to the point of making it unusable.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Apart from minimap mods configured to only show the surface, shader mods, FPS mods, and certain clients (Lunar Client and Badlion Client), modifications are banned.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. All claims, wars, and peace treaties must be handled under the #declarations forum channel to be confirmed or denied by moderators, and to be ratiifed officially.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. If you claim too much land, you'll be asked to reduce it before a moderator approves. For a sense of scale, look at other claims in #claims. Take note that larger population, development, potential popularity of the region, nearby claims, and conquest via war are all factored into how much you can claim.
    </p>
    <p>
        5. First person to claim land, gets it. Land can be joint owned, but is conquered as if it was owned by one nation.

    <h1>PlanarCraph War Rules</h1>
    <p>
        1. A war declaration is only valid upon pinging the opposing leader(s).
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Nations that have existed for 3 days or shorter are immune to war declarations, unless the state in question declares war on another entity.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. All grief rules are void in any nations involved in a war.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. If the opposition is significantly griefed, a nation can write a peace treaty. Any reasonably enforcable conditions that are broken in a treaty will void any war immunity the opposition may have.
